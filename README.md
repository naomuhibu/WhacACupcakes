# Whac-a-cupcakes
Cute cupcakes can be used as a game similar to Whac-a-Mole.

You can see the IDD on wiki page.

From IDD, I created a Trello board to plan the development of this application.

To put all files on Git Hub, I attempted to use LSF(https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs?utm_source=gitlfs_site&utm_medium=installation_link&utm_campaign=gitlfs#installing) and .gitignore, but it was not successful because the Assets and Library folders are large.  As a result, I am unable to upload them to the Github repository. I have uploaded these data to Sharepoint. You can access the link below.
